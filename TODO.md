# TODO ðŸš§

Your new site is all yours so it doesn't matter if you break it! Try editing the code.

Reference the [OwnerRez API](https://api.ownerreservations.com/help/v2) and the [MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/)

Use [console.log](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log) liberally to debug issues

```js
console.log("Something happened");
```

Click **Tools** > **Logs** at the bottom of Glitch to see the log statement in action when you submit new colors through the form.

## Keep going! ðŸš€

Clearly this is not a robust data storage approach and won't persist for long! Your Node apps can use a variety of databases, like [SQLite](https://glitch.com/~glitch-hello-sqlite) and [Airtable](https://glitch.com/~glitch-hello-airtable).
